Les Cayes, Haïti","Clearwater, Florida",Sud,Les Cayes,Pestel,,@ayitisolutions,,"The benefits of coconuts are unlimited, however we can all agree on four of them that are essential for a human”s to survive and thrive : 1) it provides fresh sweet water and this water is rich in electrolytes which are minerals that produces electrical charges  when dissolved in the blood . These electric charges regulates fluid balance such as blood pressure, muscle contraction (heart includes) and Ph balance. 
2) After enjoying the sweet coconut water, is time to enjoy the meat which is some of the water form already turned solid after the coconut as reach an age of maturity . Therefore, younger coconut mostly contains water and a jelly type of meat mostly water than solid. In addition, this meat is not all taste it”s also rich in key minerals such as manganese, copper, zinc, iron , potassium, phosphorus, selenium. It’s the richest in manganese which supports enzyme function and fat metabolism. Also, it is rich in copper which is key for bone formation and the health of the heart.  Also, did that click in to that old saying that coconut washes the heart. 
3) Now after reading the first and the second benefits of coconuts stated above. We can see why this claim made by youngcoconuts.com that coconuts are identical to the blood stream are not far Fetched, especially with old folk tales saying coconuts were used as Iv for dehydrated soldiers. However, one doctor named Graber at the university of Iowa claimed that coconut is not the ideal optimal iv response for dehydration. Also, other doctors claimed they used for oral rehydration therapy with their patients.
4) Once done with the fresh water and the tasty coconut meat. It’s time to disposed of it without worries it will cause harm to nature or turned in to a tool: create the shell into plates , planting pots or etc…  Also, the coconut husk can be  converted into rope with due process giving it”s dry enough.

So, now you are up to date, join the movement for coconuts 4 Ayiti as a solution for today, tomorrow and generations to come.
